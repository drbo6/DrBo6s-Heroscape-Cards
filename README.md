# DrBo6's Heroscape Poker-sized Cards

Heroscape is just better with Poker cards so I made these. 

Note that this design does not mention the various generals on the cards. They are only represented by their icon.

# What do these cards look like?

You can find an export of the cards in the Other/Print/Default folder here on Github, but here is a preview:

# What are these files?

These are the source files to create Heroscape Poker cards with my design. You can make your own cards if you download Cocktail ([www.cocktail.software](http://www.cocktail.software), these files use v0.9.69), but you also need to know how to edit images (Gimp, Photoshop or Affinity) and how to work a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheets).

Here is an overview of what is in here:

- DrBo6s Heroscape Cards.ctp - This is your main file for Cocktail. Use it to generate cards and open the project.

- Database - Default.xlsx - The card database. This is where you add new cards for Cocktail to generate. The cells behind the black column contains pre-formatting code for Cocktail.

- Database - Draft - Copy of Default.xlsx - A copy of the card database. You don't really need this but Cocktail currently throws up some errors when exporting the archive if you have the default and draft cards connected to the same database. The developer is aware and this should get fixed in an update.

- Frames, icons - The graphical elements of the cards

- Hitboxes, illustrations - The unique art on each card

- Sets, layouts - Cocktail files

- Wildcards - The rules cards and wildcards to be used for the included draft cards.

- Other - Additional files (see below).

# What fonts do I need?

- [Monkrita Pursuit NC](https://www.dafont.com/monkirta-pursuit-nc.font)

- [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow)

# What is the difference between draft and default cards?

- The default cards are Heroscape cards to use in-game.

- You can use the draft cards to draft Heroscape armies with. You can find the rules and wildcards in the Other/Draft folder.

# Is there a back for the cards?

It is in the Other/Back folder.

# Where are the other cards?

I only did the cards for the figures in my collection (which includes all Classic 'Scape prior to DnD). 

# What are these Modified Cards?

They are cards from my personal collection. Modified Cards have a gold dot next to the stats. Some of these are from the Competitive Unit Congress, others are renamed unique versions of uncommon heroes and finally there are some that are just straight-up custom cards.

# How do I print these?

I use MakePlayingCards.com, but there are other options as well. You can also print them yourself. In case you are not familiar with printing playing cards, please note that these cards are designed with [bleeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleed_(printing). In other words, there is excess space to the sides of the cards so that you can cut a nice clean image that is the exact same size as a Poker card.

If you like the cards the way they are, you can find all of them exported to the Other/Print folder, ready to be uploaded to MakePlayingCards.com.

# Special Attacks are not formatting correctly

You need to put "Range X, Attack Y" on a separate line from the rest of the text to format special attacks correctly. Just press ALT+ENTER to create a line break (or write your own Excel code).

# How do I...?

I am terribly sorry but I don't have the bandwidth to provide additional support for this project. I am hoping that the community can take it from here, make whatever cards are needed and help people out. Thanks for understanding.
